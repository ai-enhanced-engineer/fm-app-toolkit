Context Construction Strategies for Foundation Models

Overview
Context construction is the process of assembling relevant information to guide foundation model responses. As Chip Huyen notes, context construction for GenAI is analogous to feature engineering in classical machine learning - it's crucial for model performance and often determines the success or failure of applications.

The Four Levels of Context Enhancement

Level 1: Basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Basic RAG involves retrieving relevant documents and concatenating them with the user query. This foundational approach works well for straightforward question-answering tasks. Documents are retrieved based on similarity to the query, then provided as context to the model. While simple, this method can dramatically improve response accuracy for information-retrieval tasks.

Level 2: Query Understanding and Enhancement
Sophisticated systems go beyond taking queries at face value. Query rewriting transforms user questions into more effective retrieval queries. Query expansion adds synonyms and related terms to improve recall. Intent classification determines what type of information the user seeks. Multi-query generation creates variations to retrieve diverse relevant content. These techniques significantly improve retrieval quality for ambiguous or poorly-formed queries.

Level 3: Memory Management
Production systems must handle conversation history and long-term memory. Short-term memory maintains conversation context across multiple turns. Long-term memory stores user preferences, past interactions, and learned information. Efficient memory management requires selective retention, forgetting outdated information, and summarization of lengthy histories. Memory retrieval must balance relevance with recency and importance.

Level 4: Personalization and Adaptation
The highest level involves adapting context to specific users and domains. User modeling captures individual preferences, expertise levels, and communication styles. Domain adaptation tailors responses to specific industries or use cases. Role-based filtering ensures users only access appropriate information. Dynamic personalization adjusts context based on user feedback and behavior patterns.

Implementation Patterns

Context Window Management
Foundation models have limited context windows, requiring careful management. Token counting ensures prompts stay within limits. Priority-based selection includes the most relevant information first. Dynamic compression techniques summarize or remove less critical content. Context packing strategies maximize information density while maintaining coherence.

Prompt Engineering for Context
Effective prompts structure context for optimal model understanding. System prompts establish behavioral guidelines and output formats. Few-shot examples demonstrate desired response patterns. Chain-of-thought prompting encourages step-by-step reasoning. Meta-prompts guide the model in interpreting and using provided context.

Multi-stage Context Construction
Complex queries benefit from iterative context building. Initial retrieval casts a wide net for potentially relevant content. Refinement stages filter and focus on the most pertinent information. Synthesis combines information from multiple sources. Verification ensures context accuracy and consistency.

Advanced Techniques

Hierarchical Context
Organize context in hierarchical structures mirroring document relationships. Parent documents provide overview and structure. Child documents offer detailed information. Cross-references maintain connections between related content. This approach helps models understand information architecture.

Temporal Context
Time-sensitive applications require temporal awareness. Timestamp metadata tracks information currency. Recency weighting prioritizes newer information. Historical context provides background for understanding changes. Temporal reasoning enables trend analysis and prediction.

Multimodal Context
Modern systems increasingly incorporate non-text context. Images provide visual information and diagrams. Tables structure numerical and categorical data. Code snippets demonstrate implementation details. Audio and video enhance understanding for appropriate use cases.

Performance Optimization Strategies

Caching and Precomputation
Cache frequently used context to reduce latency. Precompute embeddings for common queries. Store preprocessed chunks ready for retrieval. Implement semantic deduplication to avoid redundant context.

Progressive Context Loading
Load context incrementally based on need. Start with high-level summaries. Add details as the model requests specific information. Stream context to reduce time-to-first-token. Balance completeness with response latency.

Context Compression
Compress verbose context while preserving meaning. Use extractive summarization for long documents. Apply abstractive summarization for complex information. Implement prompt compression techniques. Remove redundant or low-value content.

Evaluation and Monitoring

Context Quality Metrics
Measure relevance of retrieved context to queries. Track coverage of user information needs. Assess context diversity and comprehensiveness. Monitor context freshness and accuracy.

Impact on Model Performance
Evaluate how context affects response quality. Measure reduction in hallucinations. Track improvement in factual accuracy. Assess response completeness and helpfulness.

System Performance
Monitor context construction latency. Track token usage and cost. Measure cache hit rates. Analyze retrieval system load.

Best Practices

Design for Interpretability
Make context sources transparent to users. Enable context inspection and debugging. Provide attribution for information sources. Allow users to correct or supplement context.

Handle Edge Cases
Plan for queries with no relevant context. Manage conflicting information in context. Handle context that exceeds window limits. Address multilingual context challenges.

Iterate Based on Feedback
Collect user feedback on response quality. Identify patterns in context construction failures. Continuously refine retrieval and ranking. Adapt to changing information needs.

Conclusion
Context construction is a critical capability for production GenAI systems. Success requires thoughtful design across multiple levels, from basic retrieval to sophisticated personalization. Focus on iterative improvement guided by real-world performance metrics.
